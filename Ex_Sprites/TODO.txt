Hello Everyone! I'm Archytas, the Project Lead on the Rivals of Aether Adventure Mode Team. 
We're excited to show off what we have gotten done so far. 
The Adventure Mode API is what is on the tin - an API to transform a custom stage into a level
reminiscent of Melee's Adventure Mode or Brawl's Subspace Emissary.
We've been able to work around most of the limitations of regular stage codding and expand the features provided.
It currently has support for infinitely large areas, as well as hot-swapping between these infinite spaces.
It has a global event system and trigger actors.
It has a cutscene manager for handling all custom HUD elements such as dialog.
Enemies are mostly analogous to characters, with the flexibility of articles.
And it even has items, which rivals can pick up and can do anything you can code.
The best part, is that all custom code is done in user_event scripts - 
You won't have to go through the source code to make levels.
Thanks to Break the Targets', release,
most of the core features of Adventure Mode are currently bug-tested and polished. 
Thank you to everyone who creates levels for Break the Targets and contributes feedback. 
It helps the development of the Adventure Mode API more than you realize.

This means we're currently in the phase of content creation for our example level.
It will take place in the Fire Capital a few years after the Abyss Crisis.
Just because the Abyss has been sealed away, 
does not mean knowledge of it has magically disappeared.
Play as any workshop character of your choosing as you work to stop those who are meddling 
with things they do not fully understand.

If you wish to observe the progress or help contribute to the project, please stop by the discord. 
With how art-heavy this endeavor is, we need as many pixel artists as possible to make it a reality...
And programmers to develop new articles for Adventure Mode creators to mess with.

We plan on releasing the API version 1.0 with our example level soon TM. Thank you for stopping by,
and I hope to share more news with you soon. 

Also: On behalf of the Extended Workshop, thank you everyone for your dedication to the workshop community.
It rides and dies on the passion of creators and players; it's amazing to have so many dedicated individuals,
so much good content, and an outstanding audience for it all.
