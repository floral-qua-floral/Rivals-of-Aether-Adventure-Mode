RoA Adventure Mode: "Hallowflame"/"Seed of Discord" SCRIPT

CAST LIST:
PLAYER - Whoever the player character decides to be. Will designate alternates to dialog depending on lore.

KIWI - [TODO: Kei] a Kiwi fire elemental. Camp Prefect and advisor to RYKENBURN. Keeps morale up, loyal only to a fault.

WITCH - [TODO: Name] a Squirrel fire elemental with a witch hat. Mischievous, showy, encourages bad ideas for a good time. A Physician by trade. 
A local of the town, she knows secrets and information - but doesn't just want to spell it out for our guest.

DR. LACUNA - [TODO: Name] - missing foreign collaborator, provides notes and diagrams in the sewer level. Never visually seen, but implied and explicit work in capturing residents to form abyss creatures.

RYKENBURN - A Commander sent to Hallowflame on orders to put down unrest due to a lack of tribute shipments and communication with the town. Decisive and confident at the determent of being stubborn and single-minded. 
Within his framework he is cunning and cruel, when outside of his framework he is prone to loose his calm and make rash decisions.
 Learns while at Hallowflame the existence of an Abyss Seed, as well as Loxodont's plan of seizing the spark. Desperate when the players gets close to blowing his conspiracy.

SOLDIER/GUARD - Standard soldier as part of RYKENBURN's legion. Stands guard in places, cannonfoder in others. Kinda dumb & kinda brutish, with some instilled valor from FC training. All Labradors of different colors, because they are guard dogs and also saving time.

NIGHT GUARDS - SOLDIER but has a killbox mechanic as a view cone. Yes, the helmet means they don't see very far.

"
In the 5th Year of our Emperor Loxodont: Deliver to Hallowflame Command. Confidential.
Ryken, 
It is in times like this where my duty to Fire is superior to my duty to the Emperor. 
It is not safe for you to return to the Capital after this campaign. 
L has mobilized forces personally loyal and has been dispatching potential enemies to the regime.
Do not trust communication from the capital.
Your name is on his list. Your belongings have been confiscated, and your family has been taken to an undisclosed location.
I hope with this warning you can stay alive and free. And eventually, restore order.
From,
A Concerned Citizen
